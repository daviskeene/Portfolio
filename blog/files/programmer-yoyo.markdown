## _“It's not really a sport, its not really a hobby…its a spobby". - AK Kirk (on yo-yoing)._
The world of competitive yoyoing is an enticing one. You've certainly heard of a yo-yo before, but I doubt you've
 seen the true mind bending performances that competitors like Gentry Stein or Evan Nagao put together year after year.
With any skill toy, performers must dedicate countless hours of practice to achieve the muscle memory necessary to perform on stage.

Now, I'd like to make the case that every programmer should buy a yo-yo. It's true that many yo-yoers are also engineers, but I'd
argue that that's a product of nerds doing nerdy things. People that are interested in engineering principles are also the ones
who want to learn to solve rubix cubes, juggle, and take up other skill toys... like yoyoing. However, yoyoers make _phenomenal_
software engineers (exhibit A), and I believe it's because of a yoyoers ability to control their _flow state_.

## Entering Flow
Does this sound familiar? You're working on a software project, put on your Lo-Fi Hip Hop Beats to Study / Relax to, and get
to work. Suddenly, you feel infalliable, your fingers glide across the keys like birds across a lake. You're hyper-focused,
truly into your work, and then finish your task once you pass the last test case and call it a day. Several hours later, you
find that the code you were previously writing is less than perfect. A missed test case here, performance optimizations there,
and suddenly you feel compelled to re-write everything. _Who's the idiot who wrote this junk?_, you think to yourself.

What happens here is we experience a state called _flow_, often referred to as **the zone**. The zone is a de-personalized state of extreme focus. We aren't being mindful of our
keystrokes, but rather we are using the experience and knowledge available to us to complete the task at hand. Inherently,
this is not a bad thing. We need to be able to enter and exit states of hyper focus in order to meet deadlines and feel
productive. Athletes and performers rely on flow to execute their physical movements with pin-point precision. However,
while this state may be productive and beneficial for physical acts, I'd argue that it is much more important to be present
and mindful when programming (or problem solving in general) than to enter a state of unconscious focus.

## Mindful Programming
When I use the phrase "Mindful Programming", I want you to think about what this means to you. What is being mindful, really? 
How can we practice being mindful, while still retaining enough focus to program efficiently? Well, the answer to that is simple: step away from the keyboard.

We too often trap ourselves at our workstation until we have made viable progress towards our task. _I can't leave until I get this done_, you'll think.
And so we tap into the part of our brain that allows us to mindlessly write out code and browse stack overflow until we have found a solution to our problems.
This is, unfortunately, an unhealthy behavior. By not being completely in the present moment while writing code, we can fail to catch imprefections
that the trained eye would. We can tell ourselves that this is the one true solution, that nothing else works, that because @TheRealCoder007 answered on
a coding forum in October 2007 with the exact same problem, that we're doing our best work. When in reality, we aren't.

The best code that I have ever written hasn't been from a place of stress or flow. It's been from a place of complete awareness. It's the
reason why I practice LeetCode for job interviews but have a completely different approach to coding when working on a full stack application.
We can use flow to our advantage to be able to execute minute tasks effectively. But for software teams, it's much more beneficial
to the health of the codebase (and the engineers) if we remain mindful while programming.

## Yo-Yoing As Meditation
If you ask most people "How do you stay present?", many of them will shrug. It's difficult in a world full of distractions and
advertisements to ever catch yourself in the moment. One way that many people choose to practice mindfulness is through mediation.
