I was scrolling through TikTok the other day, as most 20 year olds do, when I came across a video asking people to write down
their favorite questions to ask other people. I scrolled through the comments hoping to find some good questions to ask
new friends, when I came across one in particular that caught my eye:

### "Make up a brand new word, and tell me what it means."

At first, I was slightly jarred: How am I supposed to create a new word? Do I think of a random assortment of phonemes
first, and then create a definition around it? Or do I think of a definition first, and then try to match the definition
with an appropriate sound?

I decided to create my own word: _Frelated_. A combination of the words "frustration" and "elated", it describes the feeling
when you make a breakthrough revelation, but you're mad at yourself that you didn't think of that idea sooner.

I wanted to see what other people would say, though. What other words are out there, waiting to be created by people?
And so, I went on [Omegle](https://omegle.com) of all places to find random strangers that I could ask the same question.

After several hours of trial and error, here are 50 brand new words from strangers on the Internet.

**Quink Quink** - _A Blanket_.

## Closing Remarks
Of course, because it's the internet, I wasn't surprised that a lot of these words were unoriginal synonyms of other words
or NSFW. I probably interviewed over 100 people in the 3 hours I spent on Omegle trying to get people to answer this question,
and only 50 people answered. Some were thrown off by the question, others tried and failed to even think of a new word. But
the ones who stayed and entertained my question, and those who answered with more wholesome answers, made me realize just
how different we are creatively.

My favorite words of the above list are *omidge*, *flumbus*, *vulling*, and *racka*. I think they all describe feelings
that we all know of / experience, but we haven't had a unique word to describe them.

What are your favorites on the list? And if you could make up a word, what would it be? What would it mean?
