## _"Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of."_ â€” Angelina Jolie
It's not an unpopular opinion to say that 2020 has been unforgiving. Although, in many ways, I had an excellent year: I have an amazing internship, my time at school in the beginning
of last semester was everything I could have asked for, and I met a lot of really cool people. I have many things to be grateful for, and I'm at a turning point in my life where I can
start to imagine myself being completely independent. But, I had a lot of expectations for myself coming into the school year: I thought that I could
balance a heavy courseload of online classes, two part time jobs, and a reasonable socially-distant social life all at once. Spoiler alert: I was not prepared for any of it.

I set high standards for myself, because my prior work ethic has always allowed me to power through projects and assignments while giving myself
enough time to socialize and be myself. I thought this semester would be no different; I would hit the ground running on all my assignments (giving me
ample time to work on my Jira tickets for work), rapid COVID testing would mean that I could still socialize on campus, and I could do all of this while maintaining
my care free, go-with-the-flow attitude. Right?

As it turns out, I bit off way more than I could chew. My stress came to a peak in the middle of September, when there were days that I would sit in my room
for hours at a time _petrified_ by the amount of work that I had to complete. With no in person classes, no sociability on campus, and additional stresses in my personal life
rising, I found myself in quite a rut. Late September, after noticeably losing weight and having more stress than I knew what to do with, I decided to do
something about it. Now, a month later, I feel better than I have since the summer. These are ways that I built better daily habits for myself to manage my stress in a healthy way.

## 1. Routine, routine, routine.
The first thing I did to manage my stress was to develop a daily routine that I could use to build habits. I read [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) by James Clear
to get some insight into how people develop healthy habits. My previous coping mechanisms for stress were problematic to say the least: skipping meals, procrastinating to avoid feeling overwhelmed, etc.
James' book mentions that building habits requires 4 key elements: making good habits visible, making them attractive, making them easy, and making them rewarding. 

Logically, the first step was to write out what types of behaviors I wanted to develop, and then prime my environment to make good habits more visible. But as it turns out, it's much clearer to work backwards from an identity that you'd like to
achieve, and then break down components of that identity to find desirable habits. For example, I had written the following manifestation for myself:
```
I want to soon become an entrepreneur who has the technical skills to build things from the ground up, 
the financial literacy to make smart investing and spending decisions, the fitness to handle
the physical stress that comes with starting a business, and the mental fortutide to remain calm
in anxiety-inducing situations.
```

From here, I focused on adjectives that describe this type of person:
```
Reliable, patient, healthy, focused, disciplined, happy, organized, sharp, creative, motivated,
funny, caring, clever, successful, confident.
```

And finally, I discovered habits by asking questions like:
```
What would a  ____(insert adjective here)____ person do?
```

I boiled it down to a few items that I felt were important to do daily to work towards my goals:
```
1. Read
2. Work Out
3. Finish At Least One Thing (an assignment, a work task, etc.)
4. Save Money
5. Eat Three Meals A Day
6. Wake Up Early, Go To Bed Reasonably Early
```
And now, I had actions to build habits around! To work out every day, that would require going to the gym, or running outside.
For reading, that would require purchasing books that would benefit me in the long-term. For eating three meals a day, that would
require preparing food three times a day, or ordering out on occasion when I need to fill my caloric needs.

Now that I had an idea of the person I wanted to become, the adjectives associated with that identity, and the steps I needed to associate
myself with this version of myself, I needed a way to hold myself accountable to these actions. My solution: two notebooks.

## 2. The Two Notebook Method
I purchased two notebooks at the end of September: one to keep as a daily TODO list, and another that serves as a day-to-day journal for random thoughts and other notes. In my TODO notebook, each night I write out the same things:
```
Daily Checklist MM/DD

Breakfast [ ]
Shower [ ]
Walk + Read [ ]
Calisthenics / Gym [ ]
Lunch [ ]
(insert a few school assignments here)
Dinner [ ]
Meditate [ ]

Things I'm Grateful For:
1.
2.
3.

Things I Want:
1.
2.
3.

Notable Events:

```
Now, I have a formula for each day: Start it out right by showering and eating, then going to a walk with a book to read at an external location, then work out either at home or at the gym,
and then come back for lunch. After this sub-routine finishes, I can jump start on all my work for the day in the early afternoon until I either finish or run into dinner. After eating dinner, I
can either continue work, or meditate and relax by watching some TV.

**Of course, not all days are the same.** There _has_ to be room for flexibility, otherwise it would be borderline psychotic to expect to live in "Groundhog Day" every day. I leave myself
the ability to miss at most TWO items on a checklist per day, and I also allow myself to add events / remove events from the checklist throughout the day as I see fit. It's a guide, not a mandate.

But, it has worked wonderfully. I feel in control of each day, planning out my assignments the night before allows me to manage my expectations for the amount of work I should be able to accomplish,
and I feel less stressed because _I now have visible control my day to day actions_.

The second notebook is not as interesting: it's just a journal where I'll write down anything that comes to mind. If I had a great day, I'll write about it. If I had a shitty one, I'll make a note or two.
But it's important to me to write down my actions in one notebook, and then how those actions made me feel in another. In this way, I can separate my actions from the emotions associated with them so I can
better diagnose sources of stress in my life and adjust my day to day routine appropriately.

## 3. Talking About It
Now that I had a routine, and a physical way to hold myself accountable for my habits, I still wasn't done. New habits take time to develop, and although it gets easier every day, the hard part is doing it daily.
It wasn't until I started feeling stressed that I realized I had an amazing group of friends, both at home and at school, who were there to support me and let me vent about how I was feeling. Even if I was only complaining
about how much work I had, or how much it was inconveniencing me to go to the gym, they were there to listen and help me through my problems. I wouldn't have been able to make the best decisions for myself
if it wasn't for them, so each day until my "Things I'm Grateful For" category in Notebook #1, "Family & Friends" is always there.

Also, having other people hold you accountable for your new habits / surrounding yourself with people who are beneficial to your lifestyle is crucial when you're first starting. My roommates are all in Computer Science fields,
so we all have similar courseloads, similar outlooks on potential careers, and similar desires to manage stress. Taking inspiration from their day-to-day routines and their habits has been a big influence on my own ability
to perform, and I cannot thank them enough for that.

## Closing Remarks
Stress and anxiety find a way to creep into our lives, even when we least expect it. Managing our expectations, stepping back and taking the necessary actions to combat these feelings, and talking about it with others
is crucial to maintain your mental health. Especially in engineering oriented fields, people are over-worked and stressed more often than not. It's important to develop healthy habits early, so that you'll be ready for any
challenge that life has for you.

Additionally, if anyone needs someone to talk to but they aren't sure how to start or who to seek help from, I'm always here for you! I'd love to hear about your day, how stressed you are, and what shitty things happened at work or school.
