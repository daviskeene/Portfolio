Creating my own SSG
-
Instead of using Gatsby or Jekyll, I'm going to challenge myself to create my own kind of SSG.
Rather than compile when a user requests the site, this is more of a formality for me, so that before 
I push any changes to git I can run a script that will build my page for me.

I plan to store blog posts inside of the `posts` folder and their corresponding markdown files in `files`.

Process:
-
### There's really only one clear cut way that I can think of doing this:

- Make a js file that, when executed, appends html to a div where blog posts are supposed to be.
- Also create blog html file and place it in the `posts` folder, and link it from the frontend.
- HTML will be generated by the markdown files in the `files` directory, and will have a set format.
