## _I have written 11 books but each time I think ‘Uh-oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody, and they’re going to find me out.’_ —Maya Angelou

Self doubt is, undoubtedly, the worst kind. If someone else doubts us, we are given an opportunity to prove ourselves to that individual. We get validation from
ourselves when we finally accomplish the things we set out to do, when we acquire new skills, and when we prove others wrong. When we start to doubt our own abilities, however,
our lack of action and experience is only further evidence to ourselves that we aren't good enough. This cycle of doubt is so common that we have given it a name:
Impostor Syndrome.

## The Feeling Of Faking It
I remember when I first began developing software for my robotics team in high school, many of my peers were astonished by the things our robot was able to do. We could use computer vision to
detect and drive towards blocks, PID controllers for autonomous turning to specific angles, omni-directional drive mechanisms with mechanum wheels, the list goes on. I had began programming from an
early age, and so when I took the reigns as the team's software lead I seemed to earn the respect of the team for my ability. But deep down, I would often wonder: is this response valid?

I mean, I didn't write the OpenCV wrapper for android that we were using. I didn't write the original omni-directional driving code, that was done several years ago by a former teammate. I had only improved it, I didn't create it.
Sure, I could figure out how to do the things that were required, but there was always a lingering feeling that I had to work harder to prove myself _to_ myself. The only person that I couldn't seem to convince
of my ability was myself.

The feeling of being a fraud is overwhelming and inherently negative. Some people will attribute this feeling to their overall success and conflate it with their work ethic. But I've met with many CS students at UIUC
who have all said the same thing: they feel inadequate. They're all smart and capable students, but they feel as though they should have more specific knowledge in CS. It's of no fault of their own that they didn't have
insane internships in high school, or do a robotics team / software based extracurricular. But suddenly, when they compare themselves to people who have had prior experience, they doubt their own ability.

Outside of tech, this happens all the time too. I often discard blog posts that I'm half way through writing because I can't find the right words to describe what I want to write about. Other times, I feel like I'm a pretty terrible writer compared
to my other friends who have blogs. Why don't I feel inspired to write all the time? Why don't I have more interesting things to say? The list of questions that bounce around in my internal monologue is endless. In sports, clubs, video games, lots of people
in these communities all share one thing: a fear that they're not good enough compared to others.

The question is, what's going on in the minds of the people that _are_ talented or experienced? Are they happy? Or do they experience the same feeling of inadequacy?
